                            <h1>Dubnium</h1> is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Db and atomic number 105.
                            Dubnium is highly radioactive: the most stable known isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life
                            of about 32 hours. This greatly limits the extent of research on dubnium.

                            <h1>John Onesimus Foster</h1>
                            (December 14, 1833 â€“ November 3, 1920) was an American Methodist minister.
                            He was a member of the Rock River Conference, a chaplain for the Sons of the American
                            Revolution, and a faculty member at the University of Puget Sound.Because the river was
                            icy and the weather severe, the crossing proved dangerous. Two detachments were unable to
                             cross the river, leaving Washington with only 2,400 men under his command in the assault,
                            3,000 less than planned. The army marched 9 miles (14.5 km) south to Trenton. The Hessians
                            had lowered their guard, thinking they were safe from the American army, and had no
                            long-distance outposts or patrols. Washington's forces caught them off guard and, after a
                            short but fierce resistance, most of the Hessians surrendered. Almost two thirds of the
                            1,500-man garrison was captured, and only a few troops escaped across Assunpink Creek.
