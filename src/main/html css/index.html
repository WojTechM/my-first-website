            Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan) (c. 1410–1451) was a German painter
            working in the late "soft style" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's
            tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface
            textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a
            commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German
            painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional
            polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels.
            Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.
