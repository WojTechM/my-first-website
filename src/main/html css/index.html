                        Leptinella filiformis, or slender button daisy, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy
                        family, found only in the north-eastern part of the South Island of New Zealand.
                        Thought to be extinct by the 1980s, it was rediscovered growing on a hotel lawn in 1998,
                        and in the wild in 2015.

                    <h1>Stefan Lochner</h1> (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan) (c. 1410–1451) was a German painter
                    working in the late "soft style" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's
                    tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface
                    textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a
                    commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German
                    painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional
                    polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels.
                    Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.

                    <h1>Operation Vanguard</h1> is a Military Police Joint Task Force (JTF) set up by the President of Ghana
                    in 2017 to combat the operation of galamsey in the country. Galamseyers are illegal miners and
                    have over the years depleted Ghana's forest cover. Their activities also pollute water bodies due
                    to the crude and unregulated nature of the mining process.
